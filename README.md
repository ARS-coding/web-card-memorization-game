# Card Memorization Game

Card memorization game is a mental exercise that involves remembering the positions of cards in a deck. Typically, cards are laid out face down, and the player flips them over two at a time, trying to find matching pairs. The challenge lies in remembering the positions of the cards as they are flipped, so that when a player uncovers a card, they can recall where its matching pair might be. It"s a great way to improve memory, concentration, and cognitive skills.

We've built this project with NextJS while utilizing Tailwind and the modern app router folder structure.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
